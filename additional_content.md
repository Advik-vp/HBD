### Letter 4
My Darling Swati,

Today marks another year of your incredible journey through life, and I am so grateful to be part of it. You have this amazing ability to make ordinary moments feel extraordinary just by being yourself. Your kindness touches everyone around you, your wisdom guides those who seek your counsel, and your beauty - both inside and out - leaves me breathless every single day.

I love how you laugh at the silliest things, how you care so deeply about the people you love, and how you never give up on your dreams. You inspire me to be better, to love deeper, and to appreciate the magic in everyday moments.

Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to another year of adventures, laughter, and endless love.

Forever and always,
Your devoted admirer ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Letter 5
Sweet Swati,

If I could give you one gift today, it would be the ability to see yourself through my eyes. You would see a woman of incredible strength, boundless compassion, and radiant beauty. You would see someone who lights up every room she enters, who makes everyone feel special and loved, and who has the power to turn any ordinary day into something magical.

You are my sunshine on cloudy days, my anchor in stormy seas, and my greatest blessing in this life. Thank you for being exactly who you are - perfect in every way.

With all my love and birthday wishes,
Your forever fan üåπ
